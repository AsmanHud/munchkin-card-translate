# munchkinOCR
A simple Munchkin card translator from Polish to Russian.
**There is no OCR!** Initially the OCR feature was intended as the main idea,
that cards would be recognized and translated using camera,
but later on agreed that it is too much work for such a simple project
and just drop-down choice list would suffice.
