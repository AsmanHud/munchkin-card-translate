# munchkinOCR
Database of accurate translations of cards from 
[Munchkin 9: Jurassic Snark](https://munchkin.game/products/games/munchkin/munchkin-9-jurassic-snark/) 
from Polish to Russian language.
Project is deployed using Django, as a simple drop-down choice list.
## There is no OCR!
Initially the OCR feature was intended as the main idea,
that cards would be recognized and translated using camera,
but later on agreed that it is too much work for such a simple project
and just drop-down choice list would suffice.

# How to use
The project is deployed at [Python Anywhere](mmmashneyshiy.pythonanywhere.com)
